                                     As machine learning models begin making important decisions based on massive datasets, we need to be aware of their limitations. In this specialization, we will explore the rise of algorithms, fundamental issues of fairness and bias in machine learning, and basic concepts involved in security and privacy of machine learning projects. We'll finish with a study of 3 projects that will allow you to put your new skills into action. Applied Learning Project AI Ethics research is an emerging field, and to prove our skills, we need to demonstrate our critical thinking and analytical ability. Since it's not reasonable to jump into a full research paper with our newly founded skills, we will instead work on 3 projects that will demonstrate your ability to analyze ethical AI across a variety of topics and situations. We live in an age increasingly dominated by algorithms. As machine learning models begin making important decisions based on massive datasets, we need to be aware of their limitations in the real world. Whether it's making loan decisions or re-routing traffic, machine learning models need to accurately reflect our shared values. In this course, we will explore the rise of algorithms, from the most basic to the fully-autonomous, and discuss how to make them more ethically sound. In this course, we will explore fundamental issues of fairness and bias in machine learning. As predictive models begin making important decisions, from college admission to loan decisions, it becomes paramount to keep models from making unfair predictions. From human bias to dataset awareness, we will explore many aspects of building more ethical models. In this course, we will explore fundamental concepts involved in security and privacy of machine learning projects. Diving into the ethics behind these decisions, we will explore how to protect users from privacy violations while creating useful predictive models. We will also ask big questions about how businesses implement algorithms and how that affects user privacy and transparency now and in the future.

1  FPGA computing systems: Background knowledge and introductory materials                                                                                                                                  []  This course is for anyone passionate in learning how a hardware component can be adapted at runtime to better respond to users/environment needs. This adaptation can be provided by the designers, or it can be an embedded characteristic of the system itself. These runtime adaptable systems will be implemented by using FPGA technologies. Within this course we are going to provide a basic understanding on how the FPGAs are working and of the rationale behind the choice of them to implement a desired system.\n\nThis course aims to teach everyone the basics of FPGA-based reconfigurable computing systems. We cover the basics of how to decide whether or not to use an FPGA and, if this technology will be proven to be the right choice, how to program it.\nThis is an introductory course meant to guide you through the FPGA world to make you more conscious on the reasons why you may be willing to work with them and in trying to provide you the sense of the work you have to do to be able to gain the advantages you are looking for by using these technologies.\n\nWe rely on some extra readings to provide more information on the topic covered in this course.\nPlease NOTE that most of the time, these documents are provided through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, which means that, to access them, you have to have a valid IEEE subscriptions, either does by yourself or through your university/company.\n\nThe course has no prerequisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics and it presents technical topics by using analogizes to help also a student without a technical background to get at least a basic understanding on how an FPGA works.\nOne of the main objectives of this course is to try to democratize the understanding and the access to FPGAs technologies. FPGAs are a terrific example of a powerful technologies that can be used in different domains. Being able to bring this technologies to domain experts and showing them how they can improve their research because of FPGAs, can be seen as the ultimate objective of this course. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced FPGA courses. Nowadays the complexity of computing systems is skyrocketing. Programmers have to deal with extremely powerful computing systems that take time and considerable skills to be instructed to perform at their best. It is clear that it is not feasible to rely on human intervention to tune a system: conditions change frequently, rapidly, and unpredictably. It would be desirable to have the system automatically adapt to the mutating environment. This module analyzes the stated problem, embraces a radically new approach, and it introduces how software and hardware systems ca ben adjusted during execution. By doing this, we are going to introduce the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) technologies and how they can be (re)configured. 7 videos5 readings5 assignments Traditionally, computing was classified into General-Purpose Computing performed by a General-Purpose Processor (GPP) and Application-Specific Computing performed by an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). As a trade-off between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, reconfigurable computing has combined the advantages of both. On one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance. The main advantage of a reconfigurable system is its high flexibility, while its main disadvantage is the lack of a standard computing model. In this module we are presenting a first definition of reconfigurable computing, describing the rationale behind it and introducing how this field has been influenced by the introduction of the FPGAs. 5 videos4 readings2 assignments From the mid-1980s, reconfigurable computing has become a popular field due to the FPGA technology progress. An FPGA is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects but no instruction fetch at run time, that is, FPGAs do not have a program counter. In most FPGAs, the logic components can be programmed to duplicate the functionality of basic logic gates or functional Intellectual Properties (IPs). FPGAs also include memory elements composed of simple flip-flops or more complex blocks of memories. Hence, FPGA has made possible the dynamic execution and configuration of both hardware and software on a single chip. This module provides a detailed description of FPGA technologies starting from a general description down to the discussion on the low-level configuration details of these devices, to the bitstream composition and the description of the configuration registers. 8 videos3 readings2 assignments FPGA design tools must provide a design environment based on digital design concepts and components (gates, flip-flops, MUXs, etc.). They must hide the complexities of placement, routing and bitstream generation from the user. This module is not going through these steps in details, an entire course will be needed just for this, but it is important at least to have an idea of what it is happening behind the scene to better understand the complexity of the processes carried out by the tools you are going to use. Within this context, this module guides you through a simple example, which is abstracting the complexity of the underlying FPGA, starting from the description of the circuit you may be willing to implement to the bitstream used to configure the FPGA. 6 videos2 assignments Before continuing in this terrific journey in the reconfigurable computing area, it can be useful to define a common language. Obviously, some of these terms have been already used but it is now time to better understand them and to make some order before continuing with more advanced concepts. Furthermore, as we know, FPGA configuration capabilities allow a great flexibility in hardware design and, as a consequence, they make it possible to create a vast number of different reconfigurable systems. These can vary from systems composed of custom boards with FPGAs, often connected to a standard PC or workstation, to standalone systems including reconfigurable logic and General Purpose Processors, to System-on-Chip's, completely implemented within a single FPGA mounted on a board, with only few physical components for I/O interfacing.  There are different models of reconfiguration, and a scheme to classify them is presented in this module. We can consider this module as a transitional/turning point module. We have been exposed to some terminology and concepts and we are now ready to move forward. To do this, we need to combine all the pieces of the puzzles together and to invest a bit at looking at the overall picture, and this is exactly what this module has been designed for. 5 videos2 readings2 assignments The reconfiguration capabilities of FPGAs give the designers extended flexibility in terms of hardware maintainability. FPGAs can change the hardware functionalities mapped on them by taking the application offline, downloading a new configuration on the FPGA (and possibly new software for the processor, if any) and rebooting the system. Reconfiguration in this case is a process independent of the execution of the application. A different approach is the one that considers reconfiguration of the FPGA as part of the application itself, giving it the capability of adapting the hardware configured on the chip resources according to the needs of a particular situation during the execution time. In this case we are referring to this reconfiguration as dynamic reconfiguration and the reconfiguration process is seen as part of the application execution, and not as a stage prior to it. This module illustrates a particular technique, which is extending the previous two, that has been viable for most recent FPGA devices, Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration. To fully understand what this technique is, the concepts of reconfigurable computing, static and dynamic reconfiguration, and the taxonomy of dynamic reconfiguration itself must be analyzed. In this way partial dynamic reconfiguration can be correctly placed in the set of system development techniques that it is possible to implement on a modern FPGA chip. 8 videos4 readings2 assignments After presenting different solutions proposed to design and implement dynamic reconfigurable systems, this module will describe a general and complete design methodology that can be followed as a guideline for designing reconfigurable computing systems. To design and implement a reconfigurable computing system, designers need Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools for system design and implementation, such as a design analysis tool for architecture design, a synthesis tool for hardware construction, a simulator for hardware behavior simulation, and a placement and routing tool for circuit layout. We may build these tools ourselves or we can also use commercial tools and platforms for reconfigurable system design. The first choice implies a considerable investment in terms of both time and effort to build a specific and optimized solution for the given problem, while the second one allows the re-use of knowledge, cores, and software to reach a good solution to the same problem more rapidly. This module is guiding the students through an historical view on how CAD frameworks evolved through the years. This is done to show how fast the technology is evolving and the rationale behind the choice made to improve the users experience when working with an FPGA-based system. Not only commercial tools are described, but also the personal journey done by the course instructor and his research team, starting from his early days as a PhD up to the research challenges they are nowadays working on. 9 videos7 readings3 assignments We are working at the edge of the research in the area of reconfigurable computing. FPGA technologies are not used only as standalone solutions/platforms but are now included into cloud infrastructures. They are now used both to accelerate infrastructure/backend computations and exposed as-a-Service that can be used by anyone. Within this context we are facing the definition of new research opportunities and technologies improvements and the time cannot be better under this perspective. What it is needed now is new platform creation tools, monitoring and profiling infrastructure, better runtime management systems, static and dynamic workload partitioning, just to name a few possible areas of research. This module is concluding this course but posing interesting questions towards possible future research directions that may also point the students to other Coursera courses on FPGAs. 1 video3 readings1 assignment      ['Beginner level']                       https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-intro

An ML team faces several ML business requirements and use cases. The team must understand the tools required for data management and governance and consider the best approach for data preprocessing. The team is presented with three options to build ML models for two use cases. The course explains why they would use AutoML, BigQuery ML, or custom training to achieve their objectives. This module provides an overview of the course and its objectives. 1 video This module discusses the ML enterprise workflow and the purpose of each step. 2 videos1 reading1 assignment This module reviews Google’s enterprise data management and governance tools: Feature Store, Data Catalog, Dataplex, and Analytics Hub. 9 videos1 reading1 assignment1 app item This module reviews the art and science of machine learning and neural networks.

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach was employed, with ten in-depth interviews followed by a questionnaire with additional 356 job seekers in Cairo and Giza cities; the sample includes both fresh graduates and experienced job applicants in the job market. The qualitative analysis confirmed that some respondents use organizational reputation as a signal of its performance. The path analysis technique tests the research hypotheses using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The findings revealed that the most influential variable in the intention to apply is organizational attributes, followed by organizational reputation and finally employer brand. There is a significant relationship between organizational attributes and intention to apply for a job vacancy via employer brand. In addition, the results indicate a noteworthy moderating impact of organizational reputation on the association between employer brand intentions to apply for a job and the relationship between organizational attributes and intention to apply for a job opening. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study contributes to the understanding of the direct and indirect effects of organizational reputation and organizational attributes on intention to apply through the mediating role of the employer brand. This research opens new avenues for recruitment research, considering the moderating effect of organizational reputation on strengthening the impact of the independent variables on the intention to apply and the interaction between the variables affecting the intention. Further, this study focuses on the needs of the job applicants when perceiving the organizational factors and identifies which signals can generate the intention to apply according to the signaling theory. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

It leverages real-time personality-based classification to match candidates with the most suitable roles in a scalable and precise manner. This is achieved through machine learning-driven hyper-personalization, employing deep learning models to create a predictive language model. The study encompasses two key tasks: binary classification, distinguishing sentences containing soft skills (1) from those that do not (0), and multi-class classification, categorizing positive sentences into five classes based on Big Five personality traits. The research involved a series of experiments. Initially, multiple machine learning algorithms were employed to establish baseline models. Subsequently, the study investigated the impact of deep learning versus these baseline models. The results demonstrated an accuracy of 0.79% and 0.68% for binary classification tasks, and 0.79% and 0.60% for multi-class classification tasks, using Support Vector Machines in the machine learning task, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the deep learning task, respectively. This approach showcases promise in revolutionizing the job matching process, offering a more efficient and accurate means of connecting individuals with their ideal employment opportunities based on their unique soft skills and personality traits. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The research employs online surveys and economic-statistical analysis as the primary methods. The findings indicate that the negative labour market trends in Kazakhstan and neighboring countries are projected to worsen by 2030. While the information and communication technology sector represent a highly promising area for new job creation, employers' expectations often do not align with the skill sets possessed by young professionals. Employers also anticipate a future surge in demand for cybersecurity specialists. The practical significance of this research lies in enabling young applicants to make informed decisions regarding their IT career paths, allowing employers to gain insight into the expectations of potential employees, and aiding public authorities in developing education and IT programs to combat youth unemployment. © 2024, Penerbit UTHM.

The study received financial support from OrleTECH and was conducted in partnership with the \u201CShell Kazakhstan\u201D company. The project took place from September \u7901\uE100 \u7403\u7203\u7403\u7401? to August 7, 2022. During the field stage of the sociological research, an online survey method was employed using questionnaires distributed to respondents through social networks. In the process of collecting and processing secondary information, an economic-statistical analysis method was applied. This involved analysing indicators of the current state of the labour market in the West Kazakhstan and Mangistau regions, including the number of unemployed individuals categorised by the duration of unemployment and by regions in Kazakhstan, unemployment rates in the West Kazakhstan and Mangistau regions, employers in these regions, population migration data for the first quarter of 2022, and the increase in new businesses during the same period. Data was collected from the Bureau of National Statistics of the Agency for Strategic Planning and Reforms of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2023). The online survey was conducted according to the following schedule: on July 9, 2022, questionnaire forms were posted on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Targeted advertising attracted respondents from the West Kazakhstan and Mangistau regions. Interim results were monitored daily, ensuring the quality of the survey by assessing the number and activity of respondents, as well as the completeness of the questionnaire and the presence of contradictions. The online survey concluded on August 1, 2022, after running for less than 4 weeks. A total of 183 individuals and 43 companies participated in the online survey. The study employed techniques to obtain the most representative data to ensure the sample represented the general population of unemployed citizens in the labour market. The sample consisted of 226 respondents, of whom 183 were young people aged 18 to 40, and 43 were businessmen. The sample represented individuals from West Kazakhstan, Mangistau, Astana, and Almaty. The respondents met the following criteria simultaneously: 1. They were unemployed (without a profitable hobby). 2. They were actively seeking employment. 3. They were ready to start working within one month. The respondents in the survey belonged to Generation Y, also known as millennials, who were born between 1982 and 2004. As they have grown up with the Internet, they are more involved in digital technology compared to previous generations. The questionnaire survey of respondents was constructed using simple random sampling.

All of the programmes facilitate gaining work experience and share a comparable design; however, they differ mainly in the collected workplace experience and the composition of participants. Using administrative data, we first explore the selection into each programme; second, we estimate the treatment effects on job seekers’ postparticipation absence from the registry of the unemployed. For this we argue that we have sufficiently rich data to control for selection into programs. We use a dynamic estimator and report the average treatment effects of participation in different periods between the sixth and fifteenth month after starting unemployment. For participation in earlier stages of unemployment, we confirm differences in the programmes impacts, with patterns described by previous literature; workplace experience collected in either the private sector or in a regular workplace appears to improve the chances of absence from registered unemployment of young job seekers relatively more than does participation in a public works type of programme. When compared later in the unemployment spell, the between-programme differences level out. Despite its ambivalent average impact, the public works type of programme positively impacts specific subgroups of participants. © The Author(s) 2024.

And is this difference due to the fact that different people are attracted to work for government rather than companies? It has been proposed that individuals with certain characteristics, such as having high levels of risk aversion or public service motivation (PSM), are more likely to self-select into public service. This study argues that this sector attraction effect depends on the amount of job-related information available to job seekers at different stages of the job search process. We test our hypotheses using a three-stage conjoint experimental design. The employment sector only matters to job seekers when little direct information is provided. Once more job-related information is available to them, it diminishes. This effect is especially strong for people with high levels of PSM. These findings suggest that the sector attraction effect is situational, which has important implications for theory and practice of public sector attraction. © 2023 American Society for Public Administration.
